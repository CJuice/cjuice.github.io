    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <h4>Crownsville Conservancy Property Polygon Dataset</h4>
    <p>The properties dataset was created from parcel data made available in a public rest endpoint. The property
        data was digitized from the resource during July of 2021.
    </p>
    <p>The metadata from the source data is as follows:<br>
        "This dataset contains parcel polygons of the entire state attributed with data from the State
        Department of Assessments and Taxation and Maryland Department of Planning. This data is used
        to make a cached map service. The date of the polygon geometry is contained in the polydate field,
        while the date of the linked Assessments data is contained in the sdatdate field. The Assessments
        linkage is used to update portions of the data found in Planning's MdProperty View and FINDER
        Quantum products, the date of which products are found in the mdpvdate field. If an Assessments
        account was deleted between the mdpvdate and sdatdate, the parcel polygon will still maintain
        the Account ID (accountid field) attributed to it during MdProperty View/FINDER Quantum production.
        Polygons that are attributed with valid account IDs have been dissolved with polygons with matching
        account IDs. Data documentation and product downloads for MdProperty View and FINDER Quantum are
        available at https://planning.maryland.gov/Pages/OurProducts/DownloadFiles.aspx."<br>
